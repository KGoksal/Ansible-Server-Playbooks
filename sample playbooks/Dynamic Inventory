### Working with dynamic inventory
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws/docsite/aws_ec2_guide.html

- go to AWS Management Consol and select the IAM roles:

- click the  "create role" then create a role with "AmazonEC2FullAccess"

- go to EC2 instance Dashboard, and select the control-node instance

- select actions -> security -> modify IAM role

- select the role thay you have jsut created for EC2 full access and save it.

- install "boto3 and botocore"

```
sudo dnf install pip
pip install --user boto3 botocore
```

--------

- Create file named ```inventory_aws_ec2.yml``` in the project directory. 
(Note: The inventory file is a YAML configuration file and must end with aws_ec2.{yml|yaml}. Example: my_inventory.aws_ec2.yml.)

```
vim inventory_aws_ec2.yml 
```

inventory_aws_ec2.yml:
---
plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2
regions:
  - "us-east-1"
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.Name
compose: #we define variables by compose:
  ansible_host: public_ip_address
  ansible_ssh_private_key_file: "'your_pem_file_path'" 
---


- check the inventory: 

```
ansible-inventory -i inventory_aws_ec2.yml --graph
```

```
@all:
  |--@aws_ec2:
  |  |--ec2-35-201-99-89.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  |  |--ec2-54-134-77-41.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  |--@ungrouped:
```


- Best Practice Examples for Dynamic Inventory:

1. Filter by spesific Tag Name:
plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2
regions:
  - "us-east-1"
filters: 
  tag:environment: dev #you can filter your AWS inventory by your dev environment tag.

---

2. Filter by spesific Tag Names:
plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2
regions:
  - "us-east-1"
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.Name #we will group nodes by tag name.
